# Anne Li . Jarvis Consulting

I recently graduated from Ryerson University where I received my Bachelor of Engineering, majoring in Computer Engineering. I delved into programming during my time at university and I am fascinated by its endless possibilities in solving problems. Previously I did a 4-month internship at De Havilland, an aircraft manufacturing company, where I worked as a software engineer to help build their data-visualization tool. Currently, I am a software/data engineer trainee at Jarvis where I have been able to challenge myself with various projects utilizing Linux/Bash, Java 8, Docker, Maven, SpringBoot, GCP (and MORE) in an Agile/Scrum environment. I keep myself open to trying new things; whether that be my technical abilities, in personal projects, or providing quality service, I'm always eager to continuously learn to be a better engineer.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented bash scripts that utilize docker, RDBMS/PostgreSQL, SQL, regex, awk, and crontab to automate the process of obtaining data on hardware specifications and on-going Linux resource usage data.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Implemented a CLI app that post|show|delete tweets to the user account from the command-line via Twitter REST API using the MVC architecture. Developed using common libraries (HTTP, JSON, OAuth, I/O), tested using JUnit & Mockito and deployed on docker.
  - JDBC App: This project sets up a connection to the PostgreSQL database by leveraging the JDBC API that manages customer and order records.
  - Grep App: This app echoes partial functionality of the linux command `grep` using Java 8 Stream API and Lambda expressions. It searches for a text pattern recursively through all the files in a given directory and outputs the matched lines to a designated file.

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi/tree/master/springboot)]: In-progress

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi/tree/master/python_data_anlytics)]: In-progress

**Hadoop** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi/tree/master/hadoop)]: In-progress

**Spark** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi/tree/master/spark)]: In-progress

**Cloud/DevOps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi/tree/master/cloud_devops)]: In-progress


## Highlighted Projects
**SERVE.AI (Web application)**: Developed an Online Cafeteria Application utilizing the Python/Django framework, SQLite3, Bootstrap using Agile methodologies and practices. Practiced SDLC process models, requirements elicitation, system modeling, project management, teamwork, navigating documentation, and software testing.

**SMART CITY APPLICATION**: Developed a Python/Flask web app that generates pickup schedules based on the real-time capacity of sensor-attached garbage bin. Programmed ESP8266 using C++ in Arduino IDE to send JSON data via MQTT protocol to Raspberry Pi.


## Professional Experiences

**Data Engineer, Jarvis (Jan 2021-present)**: Implemented projects that solve Big-data problems utilizing a set of tools and technologies such as Linux, SQL, Core Java, SpringBoot, DevOps/Cloud, Hadoop, Spark/Scala, and Agile. Conducted and participated in daily scrum meetings in a bi-weekly sprint. 

**Coding Instructor, Codezilla (Jun 2020-Dec 2020)**: Led summer camp programs on game development and scratch coding to help youths develop problem-solving skills.

**Software Engineer Intern, De Havilland (May 2019-August 2019)**: Developed and automated a data visualization tool to analyze the performance of the Q-Series Airline Operations business. Utilized PowerBI/VBA by extracting data from IBM Lotus Notes in CSV format and loading it into charts/reports. Worked in an Agile/Scrum environment with a team of 8 for iterating through the projects.
