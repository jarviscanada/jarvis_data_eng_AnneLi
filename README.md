# Anne Li . Jarvis Consulting

I recently graduated from Ryerson University where I received my Bachelor of Engineering, majoring in Computer Engineering. I delved into programming during my time at university and I am fascinated by its endless possibilities in solving problems. Previously I did a 4-month internship at De Havilland, an aircraft manufacturing company, where I worked as a software engineer to help build their data-visualization tool. Currently, I am a data engineer trainee at Jarvis where I have been able to challenge myself with various projects utilizing Linux/Bash, Java 8, Docker, Maven, SpringBoot, GCP (and MORE) in a collaborative environment. I keep myself open to trying new things; whether that be my technical abilities, in personal projects, or providing quality service, I'm always eager to continuously learn to be a better engineer.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi/tree/master/linux_sql)]: This project automates the process of monitoring servers/nodes of linux that are connected through a switch and communicates internally through IPv4 addresses. Implemented bash scripts that obtain data on hardware specifications and on-going Linux resource usage data.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Implemented a CLI app that post|show|delete tweets to the user account from the command-line via Twiiter REST API using the MVC architecture.
  - JDBC App: This project sets up a connection to the PostgreSQL database by leveraging the JDBC API that manages customer and order records.
  - Grep App: This app echoes partial functionality of the linux command `grep`. The app searches for a text pattern recursively through all the files in a given directory and outputs the matched lines to a designated file.

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi/tree/master/springboot)]: In-progress

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi/tree/master/python_data_anlytics)]: In-progress

**Hadoop** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi/tree/master/hadoop)]: Not Started

**Spark** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi/tree/master/spark)]: In-progress

**Cloud/DevOps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnneLi/tree/master/cloud_devops)]: In-progress


## Highlighted Projects
**SERVE.AI (Web application)**: Developed an Online Cafeteria Application utilizing the Django framework, SQLite3, Bootstrap using Agile methodologies and practices. Practiced SDLC process models, requirements elicitation, system modelling, project management, teamwork, navigating documentations and software testing.

**SMART CITY APPLICATION**: Learned about distributed System and networking technology by designing and developing an urban IoT website which generates pickup schedule based on real-time capacity of sensor-attached garbage bin. Programmed ESP8266 using C++ in Arduino IDE to send JSON data via MQTT protocol to Raspberry Pi.
