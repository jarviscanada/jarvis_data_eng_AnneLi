  "summary": "I recently graduated from Ryerson University where I received my Bachelor of Engineering, majoring in Computer Engineering. I delved into programming during my time at university and I am fascinated by its endless possibilities in solving problems. Previously I did a 4-month internship at De Havilland, an aircraft manufacturing company, where I worked as a software engineer to help build their data-visualization tool. Currently, I am a data engineer trainee at Jarvis where I have been able to challenge myself with various projects utilizing Linux/Bash, Java 8, Docker, Maven, SpringBoot, GCP (and MORE) in a collaborative environment. I keep myself open to trying new things; whether that be my technical abilities, in personal projects, or providing quality service, I'm always eager to continuously learn to be a better engineer."
